### Mashed Sweet Potatoes
* 4 pounds (1.8kg) moist sweet potatoes, such as ruby or garnet yams (about 4 large potatoes; see note)
* 8 sprigs thyme, divided
* 6 tablespoons butter (3 ounces; 85g)
* 1/4 cup (60ml) maple syrup
* Kosher salt
1. Adjust oven rack to center position. 
1. Place 2 large sheets of heavy-duty aluminum foil on a work surface. 
1. Working with 1 sheet at a time, place half of potatoes in center along with 3 sprigs of thyme. 
1. Fold up foil and crimp edges to seal tightly. 
1. Repeat with other half of potatoes. 
1. Transfer pouches to a rimmed baking sheet and place in oven. 
1. Set oven to 300°F (150°C). 
1. Roast until a thin skewer inserted into potatoes meets no resistance, about 2 hours. 
1. Remove potatoes from oven and set aside until cool enough to handle.
1. Meanwhile, melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, swirling gently, until particles are pale golden brown and smell nutty. 
1. Immediately transfer to a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. 
1. Add maple syrup. 
1. Pick leaves off of remaining 2 thyme sprigs, roughly chop, and add to bowl.
1. Peel sweet potatoes and discard skins. Add flesh to bowl with butter and syrup. 
1. Beat with whisk attachment or a handheld mixer until smooth and fluffy, about 2 minutes. 
1. Season to taste with salt.
